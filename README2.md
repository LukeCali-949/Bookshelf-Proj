RELATIVELY NEW TO REACT
BEEN LEARNING FOR PAST MONTH
THIS IS MY FIRST WEBSITE THAT I BUILT ON MY OWN WITH REACT
TOOK ME ABOUT 12 HOURS IN TOTAL

ABOUT THE SITE:
IT IS AN ONLINE BOOKSHELF, YOU CANN ADD BOOKS TO THE SHELF ALONG WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOOK LIKE AN IMAGE OF THE COVER,
LINK TO PURCHASE, AND COMMENTS. YOU CAN ALSO DELETE BOOKS OFF THE BOOKSHELF TOO.
MY REACT JOURNEY IS ONLY JUST GETTING STARTED!
THANK YOU!
